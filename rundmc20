	<h4>Now you have an awesome idea! But your developers need you to explain it properly so they can create it.
	</h4>

<p>Come on now! Let’s dance together to RUN DMC20! When you’re ready, click the timer and let’s do the RUN dance together!<br>
The first step is to write down your mindblowing idea on a paper. When you hear the BEEP in two minutes, we’ll change positions so hurry!<br>
Now, slideeee your paper to the right! Take the person on your lefts paper and write comments on it. Let them know why you don’t think it’s a good idea, but be nice! You only have 4 minutes.<br>
Next step, let’s pass the paper one more time. Now try to solve the problems on the paper. Or just try to make it sellable. You only have 4 minutes!<br>
Back to first positions! Look at your paper and look at your mindblowing baby and see what they have done to it. What do you think?<br><br>
The final move is obviously to use dotmocracy to pick the one idea you all like. But you only have 4 minutes to pick. So hurry up!</p>

<h4>DROP:</h4>

<p>Sick! You’ve got an awesome idea now! Before we go to stage XX, write your number one idea in this box.</p>
